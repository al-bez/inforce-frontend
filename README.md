    # Inforce backend API

> **NOTE:**
> project is using eslint and prettier! If you use [vscode](https://code.visualstudio.com/) as your main code enviroment - install prettier and eslint extentions

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

> You need `yarn` to be globally installed

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.
Open http://localhost:3000 to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `yarn test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.
See the section about [running tests](https://create-react-app.dev/docs/running-tests/) for more information.

### `yarn test:coverage`

Launches the test runner and creates `coverage`.
You can open `coverage` folder and laucnch `index.html` to see the results

### `yarn eject`

Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.

### `yarn prettier`

Checking all files to match prettier rules. Show warnings or errors in console if they exist.

### `yarn prettier:fix`

Runs prettier on all files and fix code formatting for current files.

### `yarn eslint`

Checking all files to match eslint rules. Show warnings or errors in console if they exist.

### `yarn eslint:fix`
